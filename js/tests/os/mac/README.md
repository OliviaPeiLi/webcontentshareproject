Changes from the master branch
==============================

phantomjs was the original PhantomJS 1.7 executable,
I replaced it with a symlink to the newer version 1.9,
which has a built in WebDriver implementation so we can
switch between SauceLabs/localhost testing almost without changes.

node is symlink to the Node.js directory
